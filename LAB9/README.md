this code creates a buzzer sound based on the distance the ultrasonic sensor detects. 
If the ultrasonic sensor detects something in the range of 2-12cm.
It will generate a tone on the frequency range of 2500Hz-500Hz based on the measured distance.
If the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance beyond 12cm, then no sound will be generated.
